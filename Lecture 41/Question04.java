Statements 1 and 2 will result in compilation errors.
Statement 3 will not result in a compilation error, since anonymous classes can have custom methods.
Statement 4 will result in a compilation error as it is taking an argument "Hello", while there should have been only empty parenthesis.
Statement 5 will result in compilation error, because it cannot declare extra methods other than those declared in the class Prefixer.
